      description: "Get a list of service schedules. The result is `Vessel-Centric` - this means that the `Vessel` is in the top of the hierarchy of the response structure. A service is a heirarchical structure with the following elements:\r\n- One or more `Services` which can contain one or more `Vessels`\r\n- A `Vessel` which can call multiple `Ports` (`TransportCalls`).\r\n- A `Port` (`TransportCall`) can contain one or more `TimeStamps`.\r\n\r\nThe number of service schedules in the list can be narrowed down by providing filter parameters. The resulting payload will always include **entire voyage(s) being matched**. This means that even though a filter only matches a single `Port` in a `Voyage` or a single `Timestamp` within a `Port` in a `Voyage` - **the entire Voyage matched** is returned. If the `carrierImportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` differs from the `carrierExportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` then the **entire Voyage** for both these Voyage numbers are included.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is when `&UNLocationCode=DEHAM` is used as a filter parameter. In this case **entire Voyages** would be listed where `DEHAM` is a `Port`.\r\n\r\nBe aware that it is possible to specify filters that are mutially exclusive resulting in an empty response list. An example of this could be when both using `vesselIMONumber` and `vesselName` filters at the same time:\r\n\r\n&vesselIMONumber=9321483&vesselName=King of the Seas\r\n\r\nIf no `Vessel` exists where `vesselIMONumber` is **9321483** and `vesselName` is **King of the Seas** then the result will be an empty list\r\n\r\nIf no `startDate` filter is provided then **3 months** prior to the request data is used. If no `endDate` filters is provided then **6 months** after the request date is used."
