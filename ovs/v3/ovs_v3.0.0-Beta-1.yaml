    API specification issued by DCSA.org
    
    This API supports <b>OVS</b> (Operational Vessel Schedules)
    
    OVS is used for sharing Vessel schedules. The Interface Standards for OVS can be read *** [here](https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DCSA-Interface-Standard-for-Operational-Vessel-Schedules-1.0-vF.pdf) ***(Needs to be updated).

    For explanation to specific values or objects please refer to the Information Model v2022.2 *** Will be updated early July ***

    For a changelog please click [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/blob/master/ovs/v3#v300). Please also [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/issues/new) if you have any questions/comments.

      summary: Get a list of Schedules
      description: |
        Get a list of service schedules. The result is `Vessel-Centric` - this means that the `Vessel` is in the top of the hierarchy of the response structure. A service is a heirarchical structure with the following elements:
        - One or more `Services` which can contain one or more `Vessels`
        - A `Vessel` which can call multiple `Ports` (`TransportCalls`).
        - A `Port` (`TransportCall`) can contain one or more `TimeStamps`.

        The number of service schedules in the list can be narrowed down by providing filter parameters. The resulting payload will always include **entire voyage(s) being matched**. This means that even though a filter only matches a single `Port` in a `Voyage` or a single `Timestamp` within a `Port` in a `Voyage` - **the entire Voyage matched** is returned. If the `carrierImportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` differs from the `carrierExportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` then the **entire Voyage** for both these Voyage numbers are included.
        
        An example of this is when `&UNLocationCode=DEHAM` is used as a filter parameter. In this case **entire Voyages** would be listed where `DEHAM` is a `Port`.
        
        Be aware that it is possible to specify filters that are mutially exclusive resulting in an empty response list. An example of this could be when both using `vesselIMONumber` and `vesselName` filters at the same time:
        
            &vesselIMONumber=9321483&vesselName=King of the Seas
            
        If no `Vessel` exists where `vesselIMONumber` is **9321483** and `vesselName` is **King of the Seas** then the result will be an empty list
        
        If no `startDate` filter is provided then **3 months** prior to the request data is used. If no `endDate` filters is provided then **6 months** after the request date is used.
      parameters:
        - in: query
          name: carrierServiceCode
          description: |
            The internal carrier service code to filter by. The result will only return schedules including the service code

          name: universalServiceReference
          description: |
            The **U**niversal **S**ervice **R**eference (`USR`) as defined by **DCSA** to filter by. The service code must match the regular expression pattern: `SR\d{5}[A-Z]`. The letters `SR` followed by `5 digits`, followed by a checksum-character as a capital letter from `A to Z`. The result will only return schedules including the service reference
          schema:

        - in: query
          name: vesselIMONumber
          description: |
            The identifier of a vessel. The result will only return schedules including the vessel with the specified IMO number.
            
            It is not a requirement for dummy vessels to have an `IMO Number`. In this case filtering by `vesselName` should be used.
          schema:
            $ref: 'https://api.swaggerhub.com/domains/dcsaorg/DCSA_DOMAIN/2.0.1#/components/schemas/vesselIMONumber'
        - in: query
          name: vesselName
          description: |
            The name of a vessel. The result will only return schedules including the vessel with the specified name.
            
            Be aware that the `vesselName` is not unique and might match multiple vessels. If possible, filtering by `IMO Number` is preferred.
            
            In case of dummy vessels an `IMO Number` might not exist in which case this filter is to be used.

          description: |
            The `UN Location Code` specifying where a port is located.
            
            Specifying this filter will only return schedules including **entire Voyages** related to this particular `UN Location Code`.

          description: |
            The `facilitySMDGCode` specifying a specific facility (using SMDG Code). Be aware that the `facilitySMDGCode` does not contain a `UNLocationCode` - this must be specified in the `UNLocationCode` filter.
            
            Specifying this filter will only return schedules including **entire Voyages** related to this particular `facilitySMDGCode`.
