  title: DCSA OpenAPI specification for Commercial Schedules
  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    API specification issued by [Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA)](https://dcsa.org/).

    The Commercial Schedules API offers BCOs, LSPs, and Solution Platforms three different methods and endpoints to access schedules from carriers based on their specific needs: Point-to-Point Routings, Port Schedules, and Vessel Schedules. 

    **Commercial schedules - point-to-point routings**: provides the product offering of single or multiple estimated end-to-end route options for a shipment in the pre-booking phase. This includes point-to-point specification of all transport legs, estimated timings, estimated schedules and interdependencies between transport legs.
     
    **Commercial schedules – port schedules**: provides, for a required specific port and starting date, the set of all vessels arriving and departing from the port with the corresponding estimated timestamps.
     
    **Commercial schedules – vessel schedules**: provides, for a required specific service and/or voyage and/or vessel and/or location, the timetable of estimated departure and arrival times for each port call on the rotation of the vessel(s).

    **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in the Commercial Schedules Interface Standard.**

    The Commercial Schedules endpoints can be implemented independently:

    `1. GET /v1/point-to-point-routes # For Point to Point Routings`

    `2. GET /v1/port-schedules # For Port Schedules`

    `3. GET /v1/vessel-schedules # For Vessel Schedules`

        The list of solutions returned in the response can be tailored to a specific need by combining available query parameters.

        The minimum required query parameters are `placeOfReceipt` and `placeOfDelivery`. If no further query parameters are used to tailor the response, the provider of the GET endpoint will return their best suggestions in the response. 

        The `GET /v1/point-to-point-routes` endpoint can be implemented independently of having implemented the `GET /v1/port-schedules`  and `GET /v1/vessel-schedules`  endpoints.

        Provides, for a required specific service and/or voyage and/or vessel and/or location, the timetable of estimated departure and arrival times for each port call on the rotation of the vessel(s).

        The list of schedules returned in the response can be tailored to specific needs by combining available query parameters. 

        A filter parameter or a combination of filter parameters MUST always be provided to call the endpoint. Examples of typical query parameters and expected payload returned in the response:

        - a) `carrierServiceCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages within a service   

        - b) `carrierServiceCode` **&** `carrierVoyageNumber`: Get a specific full voyage within a service

        - c) `carrierServiceCode` **&** `vesselIMONumber`: Get a specific vessel’s full voyages within a service. 

        - d) `vesselIMONumber`: Get all full voyages for a specific vessel across all the services in which it is involved.

        - e) `UNLocationCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages where the specific UNLocationCode is involved

        - f) `UNLocationCode` **&** `facilitySMDGCode`: Get all vessels and their full voyages where the specific UNLocationCode and facilitySMDGCode is involved

        Other combinations using `vesselName`, `universalServiceReference`, `universalVoyageReference`, `vesselOperatorCarrierCode`, `startDate`, `endDate` are possible. 

        The filter parameters `startDate` and `endDate` MUST always be used in combination with any of the other available parameters.

        The resulting payload returned in the responses will always include **entire voyage(s) being matched**. This means that even though a filter only matches a single `Port` (UNLocationCode) in a `Voyage` or a single `Timestamp` within a `Port` in a `Voyage` - **the entire Voyage matched** is returned. If the `carrierImportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` differs from the `carrierExportVoyageNumber` of the `Port` then the **entire Voyage** for both these Voyage numbers are included. An example of this is when `&UNLocationCode=DEHAM` is used as a filter parameter. In this case **entire Voyages** would be listed where `DEHAM` is a `Port`.

        Be aware that it is possible to specify filters that are mutually exclusive resulting in an empty response list. An example of this could be when both using `vesselIMONumber` and `vesselName` filters at the same time: &vesselIMONumber=9321483&vesselName=King of the Seas. If no `Vessel` exists where `vesselIMONumber` is **9321483** and `vesselName` is **King of the Seas** then the result will be an empty list. 

        If no `startDate` filter is provided, then **3 months** before the request date should be used as default. If no `endDate` filter is provided, then **6 months** after the request date should be used as default. The endpoint provider can customize these based on their business definitions and inform the consumers what to expect in a response when these filters are not used. 

        The `GET /v1/vessel-schedules` endpoint can be implemented independently of having implemented the  `GET /v1/point-to-point-routes`  and `GET /v1/port-schedules`  endpoints. 

        **IMPORTANT**: This endpoint is for carriers to make available vessel schedules to BCO, LSP, and Solution Platforms, with a commercial purpose; this is out of the boundaries of their vessel schedules alignment with other carriers and terminals for operational purposes for which the Operational Vessel Schedules [API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_OVS/3.0.0) is used between carriers, and carriers and terminals.
