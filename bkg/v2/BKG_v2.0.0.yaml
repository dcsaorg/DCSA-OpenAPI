  description: |
    <h1>DCSA OpenAPI specification for the Booking process</h1>

    This API is intended as an API between a carrier and anyone creating a `Booking`. The process includes:

    - Booking request
    - Booking update
    - Booking confirmation
    - Booking amendment
    - Booking cancellation
    - Booking rejection

    For explanation of specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model](https://developer.dcsa.org/documentation/information_models). This API specification does not define the allowable updates and their timing in accordance with the established business rules. **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in [DCSA Interface Standard for the Booking process 2.0](https://dcsa.org/standards/booking/documentation-booking-2)**.

    All other documents related to the Booking publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org/standards/booking-process/)

    ### Booking (Implemented by provider)

    It is possible to use the Booking API as a standalone API. In that case poll on the following endPoints:

        GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}

    in order to poll information about status changes.

    **Note:** All `/v2/bookings` endPoints must be implemented by the provider.

    ### Notifications (Implemented by consumer)
    It is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever the provider needs input and/or a state change. The format of the notification is defined by the [Booking Notification endPoint](#/BookingNotification).

        POST /v2/booking-notifications

    The endPoints support both a **Lightweight Notification** and a **Full State Transfer**. How much data is sent via this Notification endPoint depends on what kind of Notification is being subscribed to.

    Signing up for notifications is defined outside the scope of this API specification.

    **Note:** This endPoint is to be implemented by the consumers of the `Booking API` in order to receive push events.

    ### API Design & Implementation Principles
    This API follows the guidelines defined in version 2.1 of the API Design & Implementation Principles which can be found on the [DCSA Developer page](https://developer.dcsa.org/api_design)

        Creates a new booking request. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 1 - Submit booking request**.

        ## Precondition
        The consumer has information for a `Booking Request`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received the `Booking Request`. 

        The consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the request payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response
        The following occurs when a provider receives a `Booking Request`:

        1. The payload (`Booking Request`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means
            - all required properties are provided
            - all values provided have correct data type.

            A `carrierBookingRequestReference` (as a reference to the `Booking Request`) is created and linked to the payload in the provider system.
        
            **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `cbrr-123` will be used as `carrierBookingRequestReference`**

        3. A `202` (Accepted) response is returned with a payload containing **only** the `carrierBookingRequestReference`:
            ```
            {
              carrierBookingRequestReference: 'cbrr-123'
            }
            ```

        For `POST` `Booking Request` the process ends here. The `Booking Request`:
          - is now accepted by the provider system
          - the `Booking Request` does not yet have any status and cannot be queried (no `GET` request is possible until the `Booking Request` is further processed in the provider system)
          - a `202` (Accepted) response is sent to the consumer with a payload **only** containing the `carrierBookingRequestReference`
          - awaits further processing by the provider

        The provider will now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the status `RECEIVED` of the `Booking Request` will be communicated via a [Booking Notification](#/BookingNotification). In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the

            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}
        
        endPoint to check if the `bookingStatus` of the `Booking Request` has changed.
        
        After the status has changed to `RECEIVED` further processing can continue by provider and will be communicated via a [Booking Notification](#/BookingNotification). In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll the above endPoint.

      description: |
        Updates the `Booking Request` with the `bookingReference`. The path can contain either a `carrierBookingRequestReference` or a `carrierBookingReference`. Once a Booking has been `CONFIRMED` the `carrierBookingReference` **MUST** always be used. This endPoint corresponds with either
        - **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Booking request**
        - **UseCase 7 - Request amendments to confirmed Booking**

        This endPoint is to be used in response to
        - **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request**
        - **UseCase 6 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**

        the endPoint can also be used in case `bookingStatus='RECEIVED'` and the consumer has an update to the `Booking Request`.

        ## Precondition
        In order to update a `Booking Request`, the status of the `Booking Request` needs to be in state
        - `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Booking Request`
        - `PENDING_UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Booking Request` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request**)
        - `UPDATE_RECEIVED` in case the consumer has additional changes to an already sent update
        - `PENDING_AMENDMENT` in case the provider has requested the consumer to amend the `Booking Request` (a result of **UseCase 6 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**)
        - `CONFIRMED` in case the consumer has an amendment to the `Booking Request`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received an update (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Booking request**) or an amendment (**UseCase 7 - Request amendments to confirmed Booking**) to the `Booking Request`.

        In case an amendment was received to the `Booking Request` (**UseCase 7 - Request to amend confirmed Booking**) - the amendment will be called `Amended Booking`. The `Amended Booking` and the "original" `Booking Request` will **co-exist** until a new amendment is submitted by the consumer (via **UseCase 7: Request amendments to confirmed Booking**) or until the provider requests an update (sets the `bookingStatus='PENDING_AMENDMENT'` via **UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**). If the `amendedBookingStatus` is present it always represents the latest version of an amendment received by the provider.

        The consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response
        The following occurs when a provider receives an **update** (or an **amendment**) to a `Booking Request`
        1. The payload (`Booking Request`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means
           - all required properties are provided
           - all values provided have correct data type
        3. An empty response along with `202` (Accepted) is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.

        For `PUT` `Booking Request` the process ends here. The Booking Request:
          - is now accepted by the provider system
          - the status of the `Booking Request` is unchanged.
          - a `202` (Accepted) response is sent with an empty payload
          - awaits further processing by the provider
        
        The provider will now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the state will change to one of the following values depending on the use case for calling the `PUT` endPoint:
          - `UPDATE_RECEIVED` in case this endPoint has been used to:
            - send an update to a newly created Booking (precondition: `bookingStatus='RECEIVED'`)
            - send an update to a Booking because of a request from provider via **UseCase 2 - Request to update Booking request** (precondition: `bookingStatus='PENDING_UPDATE'`)
            - send an additional update to a Booking that has already received an update  (precondition: `bookingStatus='UPDATE_RECEIVED'`)
          - `bookingStatus` will stay as `PENDING_AMENDMENT` but `amendedBookingStatus` will change to `AMENDMENT_RECEIVED` in case this endPoint is being used in response to a request from provider via **UseCase 6 - Request to amend Confirmed Booking** (precondition: `bookingStatus='PENDING_AMENDMENT'`)
          - `bookingStatus` will stay as `CONFIRMED` but `amendedBookingStatus` will change to `AMENDMENT_RECEIVED` in case this endPoint is being used to update an already confirmed Booking via  **UseCase 7 - Request Amendments to Confirmed Booking** (precondition: `bookingStatus='CONFIRMED'`)

        Once processed, the new state will be communicated via a [Booking Notification](#/BookingNotification). In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the 

            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}
        
        endPoint to check if the `bookingStatus` and `amendedBookingStatus` of the `Booking` has changed.

        If the consumer wants to get the content of the `Amended Booking` provided via this `PUT` endPoint, the `GET` endPoint needs to be used in combination with the `?amendedContent=true` queryParameter:

            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}?amendedContent=true

        It is possible to `GET` the content of the `Amended Booking` via the example above until either:

        - the provider requests for a new amendment (**UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible
        - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 7: Request amendment to confirmed Booking**) in which case the "new amendment" provided **replaces** the "old amendment".
        - the provider re-confirms the `Booking` (**UseCase 5: Confirm booking request**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible.

        Retrieves the `Booking Request` with the `bookingReference`. The path can contain a `carrierBookingRequestReference` or a `carrierBookingReference`. Once the Booking is confirmed - it is **only** possible to use the `carrierBookingReference`. It is recommended to use this endPoint to `GET` data before an update is made to make sure latest version is being updated.

        The default payload when calling this endPoint is the "original" `Booking`. It is also possible to get the latest amendment to a `Booking` called the `Amended Booking`. In order to get the `Amended Booking`, it is necessary to use the query parameter `amendedContent` and set it to `true`.

            GET /v2/bookings/{bookingReference}?amendedContent=true

        The `status` of the "original" `Booking` is included in both payloads as `bookingStatus`. `amendedBookingStatus` and related content is only available after the provider has approved the `Booking` via **UseCase 5: Confirm Booking request** and until:
        - the provider requests for a new amendment (**UseCase 6: Request to amend confirmed Booking**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible.
        - the consumer submits a new amendment (**UseCase 7: Request amendment to confirmed Booking**) in which case the "new update" provided **replaces** the "old update".
        - the provider re-confirms the `Booking` (**UseCase 5: Confirm booking request**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible.

        If `amendedContent=true` is requested but no amendment has yet been provided by the consumer **or** the state of the "original" `Booking` is `PENDING_AMENDMENT`, then a `404` (Not Found) is returned.

        If the provider is requesting changes to the `Booking`, the `Feedback` object is used to inform the consumer what needs to change.

        In case no subscription (`Notification`) has been set up - it is possible to use this endPoint to poll on in order to detect if `bookingStatus` and/or `amendedBookingStatus` has changed.

        In case a previous request is being processed by the provider - a `202` (Accepted) with **no payload** can be used as a response until the processing is finished.

        Cancels the Booking or cancels an Amendment
      operationId: cancel-booking
      description: |
        A shipper initiated cancellation of the `Booking` or `Booking Amendment` with the `bookingReference`. The path can contain a `carrierBookingRequestReference` or a `carrierBookingReference`. Once the `Booking` is confirmed - it is **only** possible to use the `carrierBookingReference`.

        This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 11 - Cancel Booking Request by shipper**, **UseCase 9 - Cancel amendment to confirmed Booking** or **UseCase 13 - Cancel confirmed Booking by shipper**.

        ## Precondition
        In order to cancel a `Booking`, the `bookingStatus` must be either
        - `RECEIVED`
        - `PENDING_UPDATE`
        - `UPDATE_RECEIVED`
        - `CONFIRMED`
        - `PENDING_AMENDMENT`

        In order to cancel a `Booking Amendment`, the status of the `Booking Amendment` must be
        - `AMENDMENT_RECEIVED`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received a cancellation from the consumer for a `Booking` or for a `Booking Amendment`.

        The consumer will receive a `202` (Accepted) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.

        ## Flow for the `202` (Accepted) response
        The following occurs when a provider receives a cancellation request:
        1. The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.

           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means:
           - all required properties are provided.
           - all values provided have correct data type.
        3. An empty response is returned and the consumer now awaits further processing by the provider.
        
        Once processed, the `Booking` or `Amended Booking` is cancelled and a [Booking Notification](#/BookingNotification) is sent. In case of a Confirmed Booking - the provider has the opportunity to decline the Cancellation of the Booking (in which case the `bookingCancellationStatus='CANCELLATION_DECLINED'`).

      properties:
        specversion:
          type: string
          description: |
            The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event producers MUST use a value of `1.0` when referring to this version of the specification.

            Currently, this attribute will only have the 'major' and 'minor' version numbers included in it. This allows for 'patch' changes to the specification to be made without changing this property's value in the serialization. Note: for 'release candidate' releases a suffix might be used for testing purposes.
          enum:
            - '1.0'
          example: '1.0'
        id:
          type: string
          maxLength: 100
          description: |
            Identifies the event. Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event. If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same `id`. Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical `source` and `id` are duplicates.
          example: 3cecb101-7a1a-43a4-9d62-e88a131651e2
        source:
          type: string
          maxLength: 4096
          description: |
            Identifies the context in which an event happened. Often this will include information such as the type of the event source, the organization publishing the event or the process that produced the event. The exact syntax and semantics behind the data encoded in the URI is defined by the event producer.

            Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

            An application MAY assign a unique `source` to each distinct producer, which makes it easy to produce unique IDs since no other producer will have the same source. The application MAY use UUIDs, URNs, DNS authorities or an application-specific scheme to create unique `source` identifiers.

            A source MAY include more than one producer. In that case the producers MUST collaborate to ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.
          example: 'https://member.com/'
        type:
          type: string
          description: |
            This attribute contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. Often this attribute is used for routing, observability, policy enforcement, etc. The format of this is producer defined and might include information such as the version of the type - see [Versioning of CloudEvents in the Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md#versioning-of-cloudevents) for more information.
          enum:
            - org.dcsa.booking.v2
          example: org.dcsa.booking.v2
        time:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |
            Timestamp of when the occurrence happened. If the time of the occurrence cannot be determined then this attribute MAY be set to some other time (such as the current time) by the CloudEvents producer, however all producers for the same `source` MUST be consistent in this respect. In other words, either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use the same algorithm to determine the value used.
          example: '2018-04-05T17:31:00Z'
        datacontenttype:
          type: string
          description: |
            Content type of `data` value. This attribute enables `data` to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the [JSON envelope](formats/json-format.md#3-envelope) format might carry an XML payload in `data`, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to "application/xml". The rules for how `data` content is rendered for different `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in [section 3.1](formats/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data).

            For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the respective protocol.

            In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For example, if a JSON format event has no `datacontenttype` attribute, then it is implied that the `data` is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json" media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

            When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.
