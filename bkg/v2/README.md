<a name="v202"></a>[Release v2.0.2 (TBD)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG/2.0.2)
---
This is a patch release for the DCSA Booking API. A lot of minor changes have been added to this patch, here is a list of changes

- allow `countryCode` `ZZ` in case it is not known
- added `expectedDepartureFromPlaceOfReceiptDate` next to `expectedDepartureDate` for the Shipper to also be able to specify the departure date from PoR
- `transportDocumentReferences` (a list of TDR) to replace `transportDocumentReference` (a single TDR) as a Booking can potentially result in multiple Transport Documents
- `transportDocumentReference` marked as Deprecated
- `requestedNumberOfTransportDocuments` added in case the Shipper does not know the TDR(s) but knows how many are needed
- `requestedPreCarriageModeOfTransport` and `requestedOnCarriageModeOfTransport` added for Shipper to specify the Mode of Transport for `pre`- and `on`-Carriage
- add `originEmptyContainerPickup` to allow empty container pickups that are not covered by `emptyContainerPickup`
- and `fullContainerPickupDateTime`
- `EmptyContainerPickup` marked as Deprecated as `originEmptyContainerPickup` covers all cases
- `1970-01-01` should be used for `plannedDepartureDate` and `plannedArrivalDate` in case the dates are not know
- the following (extra) `Modes of Transport` have been added:
  - `RAIL_TRUCK`(Rail and truck)
  - `BARGE_TRUCK`(Barge and truck)
  - `BARGE_RAIL`(Barge and rail)

---
This is a patch release for the DCSA Booking API. The primary purpose of this patch is to include the `routingReference` property in order to reference a route found in [Commercial Schedules](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/cs/v1), it also adds the `NAC` (Named Account Customer) party to `otherDocumentParty`. Here is a list of changes

- `routingReference` property added to the Booking object. When `routingReference` is provided, other properties should be omitted. The conditions for the following properties have changed: `carrierServiceName`, `carrierServiceCode`, `universalServiceReference`, `carrierExportVoyageNumber`, `universalExportVoyageReference`, `expectedDepartureDate`, `expectedArrivalAtPlaceOfDeliveryStartDate`, `expectedArrivalAtPlaceOfDeliveryEndDate`, `Vessel` object and the following `shipmentLocationTypeCodes`: `PRE` (Place of Receipt), `POL` (Port of Loading), `POD` (Port of Discharge) and `PDE` (Place of Delivery)
- `NAC` (Named Account Customer) added as partyFunctionCode on `otherDocumentParty` object
- removed Servers list that was wrongly added (no Virtual Servers are connected to DCSA APIs)
- removed the reference to `ISO 8601` in the `errorDateTime` property in the `Error` object (all dateTime fields must comply with [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6))

Going forward Beta 3 will not be updated anymore. The new way of working will be that we update the final v2.0.0 continuously. Every once in a while we release "Snapshots". An example of this is the [Snapshot of 14 June 2024](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/bkg/v2#v200B20240614) just above.

<a name="v200B2"></a>[Release v2.0.0 Beta 2 (12 April 2024)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_BKG/2.0.0-Beta-2)
---
Beta 2 release of the DCSA OpenAPI definitions for Booking 2.0.0.
## Business changes:
This is a list of high-level business changes:
- `DocumentParties` structure has been changed so it no longer is a "one-size fits all" solution.
- `[Origin|Destination]ChargesPaymentTerms` have been updated to allow a differentiation between `port`, `haulage` and `other` payment codes (`PRE` or `COL`).
- longer `vesselName` and `vesselIMONumber` allowed
- `codeListProvider` list cleaned up and all SP (Solution Providers) have been added
- `UNLocationCode` added as a property on Party-addresses
## Technical changes:
This is a list of high-level technical changes:
- The API is now developed using ShopLight instead of SwaggerHub-editor. This means that we are no longer using Domains but now have everything defined inline.
- As a new principle:
  - no $ref pointing outside the yaml file
  - all `simpleTypes` are now specified "inline" in objects
  - all `objects` are now PascalCased and have a `title` property set with a presentable version of the object name in Title Case (all representations of snake_case or Pascal_Snake_Case have been removed)
- all strings having a pattern that matches `^\S+(\s+\S+)*$` have been changed to `\S(?:.*\S)?$` in order to prevent [Catastrophic Backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)
- `additionalProperties= false` have been added to the `UNLocationLocation` in order to prevent schema errors when `UNLocation` is used together with a `FacilityLocation` in a `oneOf` construction (prevents schema error: _should be valid to one and only one schema, but 2 are valid_)
## List of detailed changes
- API description has been updated with new link to Information Model and Interface documents. Link to the Stats API has been updated
- all endPoint examples have been updated to reflect changes
- `RequestedChange` object has split the `field` property into 2 properties: `property` and `jsonPath` in order to align with the `DetailedError` object
- fixed some typos in the `ErrorResponse` descriptions
- `Address` object
  - no longer has a `name` property
  - `country` property has been changed to `countryCode`
  - `floot` example changed to `2nd`
  - no required properties in the object
- `UNLocationLocation` interface has `additionalProperties= false` in order to prevent schema violations when included in a `oneOf` construction together with a `FacilityLocation` in properties defining a location
- `CreateBooking` object has the following changes:
  - `title` changed from `Booking` --> `Create Booking`
  - `documentParties` is now a required property
  - `originChargesPaymentTermCode` and `destinationChargesPaymentTermCode` has changed from being a string to being a structure with the following properties: `haulageChargesPaymentTermCode`, `portChargesPaymentTermCode` and `otherChargesPaymentTermCode` which can all be either Prepaid (`PRE`) or Collect ( `COL`). Both properties have also been renamed to `originChargesPaymentTerm` and `destinationChargesPaymentTerm` (so the name no longer ends with `Code`)
  - `vessel` object has been updated so
    - `name` (vesselName) has maxLength changed from `35` --> `50`
    - `vesselIMONumber` has maxLength changed from `7` --> `8`, `minLength=7` has been added and the pattern has been changed to `^\\d{7,8}$`
  - `universalServiceReference` added a `minLength` of 8 (as the `universalServiceReference` must be exactly 8 characters long)
  - `universalExportVoyageReference` added a `minLength` and `maxLength` to both 5 characters (as `minLength` must be exactly 5 characters long)
  - `declaredValueCurrency` added a `minLength` of 3 (as the `declaredValueCurrency` must be exactly 3 characters long)
  - `exportDeclarationReference` and `importLicenseReference` descriptions no longer require any conditions
  - `invoicePayableAt` structure changed - it is no longer a `oneOf` between a `UNLocationLocation` and an `AddressLocation`. `invoicePayableAt` is now an object consisting of a single property: `UNLocationCode` which is required
  - `placeOfBLIssue` structure changed to a more simple structure. It is now a `oneOf` between a `UNLocationCode` and a `countryCode`
  - `documentParties` structure changed - it is no longer a list of `DocumentParties` but an object containing a required `bookingAgent` and optional `shipper`, `consignee`, `serviceContractOwner`, `carrierBookingOffice` and `other` documentParties
  - added a `minItems` of 1 on `ShipmentLocations` as it is a required property
  - added a `minItems` of 1 on `RequestedEquipments` as it is a required property
- `UpdateBooking` object has the same changes as `CreateBooking` except:
  - `title` changed from `Booking` --> `Update Booking`

  - `title` stays as `Booking`

    - COX (Invoice payer on behalf of the consignee)
    - N1 (First Notify Party)
    - N2 (Second Notify Party)
    - NI (Other Notify Party)
- added 5 new "Document Party" objects: `BookingAgent`, `Shipper`, `Consignee`, `ServiceContractOwner` and `CarrierBookingOffice` to be used in the new `documentParies` structure
- `Party` now uses the `PartyAddress` object (instead of the `Address` object)
- `IdentifyingCode` structure has the following changes:
  - `codeListProvider` has changed `maxLength` from 5 --> 100
  - `codeListProvider` has a new list of allowed values: `WAVE` (Wave), `CARX` (CargoX), `ESSD` (EssDOCS), `IDT` (ICE Digital Trade), `BOLE` (Bolero), `EDOX` (EdoxOnline), `IQAX` (IQAX), `SECR` (Secro), `TRGO` (TradeGO), `ETEU` (eTEU), `GSBN` (Global Shipping Business Network), `WISE` (WiseTech), `GLEIF` (Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation), `W3C` (World Wide Web Consortium), `DNB` (Dun and Bradstreet), `FMC` (Federal Maritime Commission), `DCSA` (Digital Container Shipping Association) and `ZZZ` (Mutually defined)
