    Polling can be done on the <b>GET /v2/events</b> endPoint. It is also possible to setup a subscription on the <b>/v2/event-subscriptions</b> endPoints in order to use the push model. Here events are pushed as they occur.

        Returns all events filtered by the queryParameters.

        <b>NB</b>&#58; It is possible to combine queryParameters. When combining queryParameters be aware that it is also possible to make combinations that are mutual contradicting.

        Example&#58; <i>shipmentEventTypeCode=DRFT and equipmentEventTypeCode=GTIN</i>

        Since there is no event that can be a ShipmentEvent <u>and</u> an EquipmentEvent at the same time <b>this will return an empty list<b>!

          The type of event(s) to filter by. Possible values are

          Parameters used to configure the subscription. It is possible to only receive cirtain types of events by adding filter values to the subscription.

          All values in the subscription body except&#58; <i>callback, secret and subscriptionID</i> will be used as filters. All filters specified must be filfilled in order to match an Event. A logical <b>AND</b> is used between filters. So

          <i>shipmentEventTypeCode=DRFT<b>&</b>carrierBookingReference=ABC123123</i>

          means that the events matched must both be Draft (shipmentEventTypeCode=DRFT) <b>and</b> be connected to carrierBookingReference ABC123123 (carrierBookingReference=ABC123123)

          Filters that are specified as (comma separated) lists use logical <b>OR</b> between list values. So

          <i>eventType=SHIPMENT,TRANSPORT</i>

          means that <b>both</b> Shipment- <b>and</b> Transport-events will be matched by this subscription.
