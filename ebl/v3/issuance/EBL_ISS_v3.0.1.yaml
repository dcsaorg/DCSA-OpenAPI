  title: DCSA eBL Issuance API
  description: |
    <h1>DCSA OpenAPI specification for the issuance of an electronic Bill of Lading (referred to as eBL) via an eBL Solution Provider</h1>

    This API is intended as an API between a carrier and a eBL Solution Platform.

    The eBL Solution Provider is to implement

        PUT /v3/ebl-issuance-requests

    for the carrier to call and the carrier is to implement

        POST /v3/ebl-issuance-responses

    for the eBL Solution Provider to call.

    When the document is to be surrendered, it should happen via a version of the [DCSA eBL Surrender](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_SUR/3.0.0) API.

    ### API Design & Implementation Principles
    This API follows the guidelines defined in version 2.0 of the API Design & Implementation Principles which can be found on the [DCSA Developer Portal](https://developer.dcsa.org/api_design)

    ### Digital Signatures
    Please look at the following implementation guide for how to create [Digital Signatures](https://developer.dcsa.org/implementing-digital-signatures-for-transport-documents).

            Platform acknowledges the issuance request and will follow up later with a response via the DCSA_ISS_RSP API. Please see the API description for the concrete link and version.

            Note that the platform MUST NOT accept an issuance request twice. If the client misbehaves and attempts to complete the same transaction more than once, then the platform must ensure that at most one of these requests sees a successful response.  The rest should an error instead.

            An Issuance Request is made with a `Transport Document Reference` (TDR), that was used previously to request the issuance of a `Transport Document` (TD). The document is either already issued or an TD with the same TDR.

            The eBL platform will inform the carrier when the carrier needs to act on this document again. If the issuance is pending, then the carrier will be notified via the `/v3/ebl-issuance-responses` endPoint once the issuance process completes. If the issuance has already succeeded, the eBL platform will notify the carrier when there is a surrender request via the DCSA_EBL_SUR API.

            This attribute is used to provide integrity of various parts of the payload that enable parties to
            validate whether a payload matches what the carrier issued originally. Accordingly, the payload is
            signed by the carrier.

            The platforms verdict on the issuance of the eBL  identified by the `transportDocumentReference`

            Options are:
              - `ISSU`: The document was successfully `ISSU` and successfully delivered to the initial possessor.
              - `BREQ`: The platform reviewed the document and believe they cannot issue the document due to an error/issue with the content of the issuance request.
              - `REFU`: The eBL issuance is rejected for a reason that the issuing eBL platform cannot resolve (for example when an Interoperable transfer fails, due to a reject of the receiving eBL platform via the `BENV` code from the interoperability standard). One reason could be that the `issueTo` referenced a valid eBL platform but the receiving platform did not recognise the recipient specified.

            Regardless of the response code, the issuance request is now considered handled. In case of successful issuance, the platform will still have some responsibility but that is covered by other processes and APIs (e.g., the DCSA_SUR API mentioned in the description of this API). In case of failed issuance, it is up to the carrier to resolve the issue and, if needed, submit a revised issuance request.

            - ISSU
