Beta 2 release of the DCSA OpenAPI definitions for Bill of Lading Surrender 3.0.0-Beta-2
## Business changes:
This is a list of high-level business changes:
- all `Party` objects (`TransactionParty` and `SurrenderRequestBy`) have been aligned with EBL 3.0.0 Beta 2

- As a new principle:
  - no $ref pointing outside the yaml file
  - all `simpleTypes` are now specified "inline" in objects
  - all `objects` are now PascalCased and have a `title` property set with a presentable version of the object name in Title Case (all representations of snake_case or Pascal_Snake_Case have been removed)
- all strings having a pattern that matches `^\S+(\s+\S+)*$` have been changed to `\S(?:.*\S)?$` in order to prevent [Catastrophic Backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)
## List of detailed changes
- API description has been updated with new links (including Stats API). A link to this ChangeLog has been added
- `tags` section has been added
- `operationId` property added to all endPoints
