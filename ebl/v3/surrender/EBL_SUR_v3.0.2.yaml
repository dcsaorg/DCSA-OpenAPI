  title: DCSA eBL Surrender API
  description: |
    <h1>DCSA OpenAPI specification for the surrender of an electronic Bill of Lading (referred to as eBL) via an eBL Solution Provider for amendment (incl. switch to paper), and delivery</h1>

    This API is intended as an API between a carrier and an eBL Solution Platform.

    The eBL Solution Platform will submit surrender requests to the carrier, via
    
        POST /v3/ebl-surrender-requests
    
    which will be processed asynchronously. The eBL Solution Platform submitting the surrender request to the carrier must be the same eBL Solution Platform from which the eBL was issued. Responses to the surrender requests will be submitted by the carrier via 
    
        POST /v3/ebl-surrender-responses

    When the platform submits a surrender request, the platform guarantees *all* of the following:

    1) The surrender request was submitted by the sole possessor of the eBL.
    2) Depending on the eBL type:
       * For non-negotiable ("straight") eBLs, the surrender request was submitted by either the original shipper OR the consignee.
       * For negotiable eBLs with a named titleholder, the surrender request was submitted by the named titleholder.
       * For negotiable eBLs without a named titleholder / blank eBLs, possession is sufficient for the entity surrendering the eBL.
    3) The carrier holds possession of the eBL with this surrender request  until it responds to this surrender request.

    Please see the [Surrender Request](#/surrenderRequestDetails) for details on what data the platform will provide.

    The processes for amendments to eBL (including switch to paper) and for surrender of the eBL for delivery of the goods shall be exclusively governed by and executed in accordance with the Bylaws of the eBL Platform where the Surrender for amendment or Surrender for delivery was received, including establishing whether the User in Control performing the Surrender for amendment or Surrender for delivery is entitled to carry out this action.

          2) Depending on the eBL type:
           * For non-negotiable ("straight") eBLs, the surrender request was submitted by either the original shipper OR the consignee.
           * For negotiable eBLs with a named titleholder, the surrender request was submitted by the named titleholder.
           * For negotiable eBLs without a named titleholder / blank eBLs, possession is sufficient for the entity surrendering the eBL.
          3) The carrier holds possession of the eBL with this surrender request  until it responds to this surrender request.

            - `AREQ` (Requested to Surrender for Amendment)

            The surrender request code determines the type of surrender request. Any parallel negotiation between the consignee and the carrier related to any of these type surrender are handled outside this API. Examples could be the shipment release related to a Surrender for Delivery or the actual contents of the amendment in a surrender related to an amendment.

            Note that "Switch to paper" is considered an amendment in how it is modelled via the DCSA eBL data standard.

        endorsementChain:
          type: array
          description: |
            A list of one or more actions that affect an eBL, starting from its issuance onward. It is equivalent to the "back side" of a physical Bill of Lading. The type of actions recorded in the endorsement chain as defined by the DCSA standard are listed below:

            - **Issue:** The act of issuing an eBL to the `Issue to` party, meaning the designated recipient of the action (typically the shipper or their on behalf of party). 
            - **Endorse:** The act of transferring the rights and obligations associated with the eBL to a new endorsee, meaning the designated recipient of the action, allowing them to claim or deal with the goods. The newly appointed endorsee may **NOT** further endorse the eBL to another party. Only applicable to negotiable eBL (`isToOrder=true`).
            - **Sign:** The act of visibly marking the actor's possession of the eBL within the chain. This action has no designated recipient and can only be performed while the actor is the current possessor of the eBL, similar to how a party may sign a physical Bill of Lading while in their possession.
            - **Request Surrender for Amendment:** The act of surrendering an eBL so that the carrier can issue an amended version. If the request is accepted, the original eBL is voided, and the amended eBL must be reissued with a new endorsement chain. This action is also used when switching the eBL to a physical document (“switch to paper”), which is treated as part of the amendment process in the DCSA standard.
            - **Request Surrender for Delivery:** The act of surrendering an eBL to the carrier to request delivery of the goods.
            - **Blank Endorse:** The act of transferring the rights and obligations associated with the eBL in blank, meaning that the endorsement does not specify a recipient. A party in possession of a blank endorsed eBL is allowed to claim or deal with the goods. Only applicable to negotiable eBL (`isToOrder=true`).
            - **Endorse to Order:** The act of transferring the rights and obligations associated with the eBL to a new endorsee, meaning the designated recipient of the action, allowing them to claim or deal with the goods. The newly appointed endorsee can further endorse the eBL to another party. Only applicable to negotiable eBL (`isToOrder=true`).
            - **Transfer:** The act of transferring the possession of the eBL to the recipient.
            - **Surrendered:** The act of confirming that the eBL has been surrendered, meaning that its lifecycle is completed.

            **Note:** DCSA member carriers have agreed that the name `endorsementChain` is still the correct name for this list of actions.

If the surrender is due to an amendment, the carrier will follow up with issuing the amended document to the party that submitted the surrender. The carrier will immediately become the possessor of the bill and can now void it.

            When the carrier rejects the surrender (`SREJ`), the eBL is returned to the party that submitted the surrender request.
