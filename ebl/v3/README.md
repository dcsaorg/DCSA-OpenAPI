<a name="v301"></a>[Release v3.0.1 (30 July 2025)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL/3.0.1)
---
This is a patch version for the DCSA Bill of Lading API. The primary reason for this patch is the `ShippingInstructionRequestor` party and adding a `transportDocumentReference` by Shipper, but other improvements have been added as well:
## Schema changes
- added `shippingInstructionsRequestor` as an optional party
- added `transportDocumentReference` as an optional property when creating and updating a `Shipping Instructions`
- removed `nullable=false` as false is the default
- updated `partyFunctionCode` for the `TransportDocument` as it was wrongly aligned with `ShippingInstructions` (`CS` (Consolidator), `MF` (Manufacturer) and `WH` (Warehouse Keeper) removed)
- added `carrierCode` and `carrierCodeListProvider` to identify which carrier a ShippingInstructions should be sent to

## Minor changes
- removed Servers list that was wrongly added (no Virtual Servers are connected to DCSA APIs)
- added an extra **Note** on the `dispalyedAdress` mentioning that some carriers might allow for more than 2 lines for physical Bill of Ladings
- updated spelling for Jerr**i**cans -> Jerr**y**cans
- updated some typos
- removed the reference to `ISO 8601` (all dateTime fields must comply with [RFC 3339, section 5.6](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339#section-5.6))
- fixed some formatting in the `transportDocumentStatus` description and some places referring to `Transport Document`
- `codeListProvider` and `sendToPlatform` updated with the following values: `COVA` (Covantis), `ETIT` (e-title), `KTNE` (KTNET) and `CRED` (Credore)
- clarifies which party `partyContactDetails` refers to

---
Going forward Beta 3 will not be updated anymore. The new way of working will be that we update the final v3.0.0 continuously. Every once in a while we release "Snapshots". An example of this is the [Snapshot of 14 June 2024](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-OpenAPI/tree/master/ebl/v3#v300B20240614) just above.

<a name="v300B2"></a>[Release v3.0.0 Beta 2 (12 April 2024)](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL/3.0.0-Beta-2)
---
Beta 2 release of the DCSA OpenAPI definitions for EBL 3.0.0.
## Business changes:
This is a list of high-level business changes:
- `DocumentParties` structure has been changed so it no longer is a "one-size fits all" solution.
- `[Origin|Destination]ChargesPaymentTerms` have been updated to allow a differentiation between `port`, `haulage` and `other` payment codes (`PRE` or `COL`).
- longer `vesselName` and `vesselIMONumber` allowed
- `codeListProvider` list cleaned up and all SP (Solution Providers) have been added
- `UNLocationCode` added as a property on Party-addresses
- calculated fields have been removed from `UtilizedTransportEquipment` and `ConsignmentItems`
- `ShippingMarks` have been moved from `ConsignmentItem` --> `CargoItem`

- `Seal` no longer supports `type` nor can the `source` be: `PHY` (Phytosanitary)
- support for multiple `Vessel`/`Vouyage` on `TransportDocument` (e.g. the first sea going vessel and the mother vessel)
## Technical changes:
This is a list of high-level technical changes:
- The API is now developed using ShopLight instead of SwaggerHub-editor. This means that we are no longer using Domains but now have everything defined inline.
- As a new principle:
  - no $ref pointing outside the yaml file
  - all `simpleTypes` are now specified "inline" in objects
  - all `objects` are now PascalCased and have a `title` property set with a presentable version of the object name in Title Case (all representations of snake_case or Pascal_Snake_Case have been removed)
- all strings having a pattern that matches `^\S+(\s+\S+)*$` have been changed to `\S(?:.*\S)?$` in order to prevent [Catastrophic Backtracking](https://www.regular-expressions.info/catastrophic.html)
- `additionalProperties= false` have been added to the `UNLocationLocation` in order to prevent schema errors when `UNLocation` is used together with a `FacilityLocation` in a `oneOf` construction (prevents schema error: _should be valid to one and only one schema, but 2 are valid_)
## List of detailed changes

Both properties have also been renamed to `originChargesPaymentTerm` and `destinationChargesPaymentTerm` (so the name no longer ends with `Code`)
