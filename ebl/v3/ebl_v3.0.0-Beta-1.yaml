  description: |
    API specification issued by DCSA.org.
    
    For explanation of specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model v2023.Q4](https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DCSA-Information-Model-2023.Q4.pdf). This API specification does not define the allowable updates and their timing in accordance with the established business rules. Refer to the [DCSA Interface Standard for the Bill of Lading 3.0 Beta 1](https://dcsa.atlassian.net/wiki/external/Y2MwYmRiMmE4MTc2NGJmOGI3ZDczZTQ1ZTM0NzQxYWY) to address this. **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in the eBL IFS**.
    
    All other documents related to the Electronic Bill of Lading publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org)

    It is possible to use the eBL API as a standalone API. In that case use one of the poll endPoints:

        GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}  # For Shipping Instructions status
        GET /v3/transport-documents/{transportDocumentReference}  # For Transport Document status
    
    in order to poll information about status changes.

    ### Notifications
    It is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever the provider needs input and/or a state change. The format of the notification is defined by the [Electronic Bill of Lading Notification API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1). Signing up for notifications is defined outside the scope of this API specification.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to the Electronic Bill of Lading API. Further details can be found [here](https://developer.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api)

        Creates a Shipping Instructions
      operationId: 'create-shipping-instructions'
      description: |
        Creates a new `Shipping Instructions`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**.
        
        ## Precondition
        The consumer has information for a `Shipping Instructions`. The empty equipment has been released to the shipper. The `Booking` is in state `CONFIRMED`.
        
        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received the `Shipping Instructions`.
        
        The consumer will receive a `201` (Created) if the payload schema validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.
        
        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives a `Shipping Instructions`:
        1. The payload (`Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        
           **The process stops here!**
        
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means:
            - all required properties are provided.
            - all values provided have correct data type.

           A `shippingInstructionsReference` (as a reference to the `Shipping Instructions`) is created and stored along with the payload in the provider system.
          
           **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**

        3. A `201` (Created) response is returned with the following payload:
            ```
            {
              shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',
              shippingInstructionsStatus: 'RECEIVED'
            }
            ```
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/shipping-instructions-notifications).

        For `POST` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Shipping Instructions`
        
          - is now stored in the provider system
          - has status `RECEIVED`
          - awaits further processing by the provider
          - a `201` (Created) response is sent to the consumer with a payload containing `documentStatus=RECEIVED`
          - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified.
        
        The provider wil now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the new status of the `Shipping Instructions` will be communicated via a `Shipping Instructions Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the
        
            GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}
            
          endPoint to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.

        Updates the `Shipping Instructions` with the `documentReference`. The path can contain either a `shippingInstructionsReference` or a `transportDocumentReference`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**

        ### Precondition
        In order to update a `Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Shipping Instructions` needs to be in state:
        
        - `RECEIVED` in case the consumer has updated information for the `Shipping Instructions`
        - `PENDING UPDATE` in case the provider has requested the consumer to update the `Shipping Instructions` (a result of **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received an update to the `Shipping Instructions` (**UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**), from now on called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`.
        
        The `Updated Shipping Instructions` and the "original" `Shipping Instructions` **co-exist** until a new update is submitted by the consumer (via **UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) or until the provider requests an update (sets the `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING UPDATE'` via **UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**). The `Updated Shipping Instructions` always represents the latest version of an update received by the provider.

        The consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.
        
        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives an **update** to a `Shipping Instructions`
        1. The payload (`Updated Shipping Instructions`) is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        
           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid which means:
            - all required properties are provided
            - all values provided have correct data type.
          
            The `Updated Shipping Instructions` is stored in the provider system alongside the "original" `Shipping Instructions`.

           **For the rest of this description and in all examples the value `si-123` will be used as `shippingInstructionsReference`**
        
        3. The response depends on which use case is the reason for calling this endPoint (what the `shippingInstructionsStatus` is):
        
            - If `shippingInstructionsStatus` **is** `RECEIVED`, then this endPoint is being used in addition to **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**. In this case the consumer would like to make an update to an already sent `Shipping Instructions`. This is done via **UseCase 3 - Submit updated Shipping Instructions**. The `shippingInstructionsStatus` stays as `RECEIVED`, `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` is set to `UPDATE RECEIVED`
            
              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned:
              ```
              {
                shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',
                shippingInstructionsStatus: 'RECEIVED',
                updatedShippingInstructionsStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'
              }
              ```

            - If `shippingInstructionsStatus` is `PENDING UPDATE`, then this endPoint is being used as a response to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions** in this case the provider has requested an update to a `Shipping Instructions`. The `shippingInstructionsStatus` remains `PENDING UPDATE`, `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` is set to `UPDATE RECEIVED`.
              
              A `200` (OK) response corresponding to the following payload is returned:
              ```
              {
                shippingInstructionsReference: 'si-123',
                shippingInstructionsStatus: 'PENDING UPDATE',
                updateShippingInstructionsStatus: 'UPDATE RECEIVED'
              }
              ```
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/shipping-instructions-notifications).

        For `PUT` `Shipping Instructions` the process ends here. The `Updated Shipping Instructions`
        
          - is now stored in the provider system
          - a `200` (OK) response is sent to the consumer with the status of the `Shipping Instructions` and the `Updated Shipping Instructions` with one of the following combinations (depending on the use case):
            - `shippingInstructionsStatus='RECEIVED'` and `updateShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used to make an update to a Submitted Shipping Instructions - **UseCase 1 - Submit Shipping Instructions**)
            - `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING UPDATE'` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus='UPDATE RECEIVED'` (if endPoint used as a response to **UseCase 2 - Request to update Shipping Instructions**)
          - awaits further processing by the provider
          - '_relevant_' subscribers have been notified.
        
        The provider wil now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the new status of the `Shipping Instructions` and `Updated Shipping Instructions` will be communicated via a `Shipping Instructions Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the
        
            GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}
            
          endPoint to check if the `shippingInstructionsStatus` and `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` of the `Shipping Instructions` has changed.
          
          If the consumer wants to get the content of the `Update Shipping Instructions` provided via this `PUT` endPoint,  the `GET` endPoint needs to be used in combination with the `?updatedContent=true` queryParameter:
          
            GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}?updatedContent=true
            
          It is possible to `GET` the content of the `Updated Shipping Instructions` via the example above until either:
          - the provider requests for a new update (**UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessible
          - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "new update" provided **replaces** the "old update".

        Retrieves the `Shipping Instructions` with the `documentReference`. The path can contain a `shippingInstructionsReference` or a `transportDocumentReference`. It is recommended to use this endPoint to `GET` data before an update is made to make sure latest version is being updated.
        
        The default payload when calling this endPoint is the "original" `Shipping Instructions`. It is also possible to get the latest update to a `Shipping Instructions` called the `Updated Shipping Instructions`. In order to get the `Update Shipping Instructions`, it is necessary to use the query parameter `updatedContent` and set it to `true`.
        
            GET /v3/shipping-instructions/{documentReference}?updatedContent=true
        
        The `status` of the "original" `Shipping Instructions` is included in both payloads as `shippingInstructionsStatus`. `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` and related content is only available after a consumer has requested an update via **UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions** and until:
        - the provider requests for a new update (**UseCase 2: Request to update Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "old update" is no longer accessable.
        - the consumer submits a new update (**UseCase 3: Submit updated Shipping Instructions**) in which case the "new update" provided **replaces** the "old update".
        
        If `updatedContent=true` is requested but no update has yet been provided by the consumer **or** the state of the "original" `Shipping Instructions` is `PENDING UPDATE`, then a `404` (Not Found) is returned.

        If the provider is requesting some changes to the `Shipping Instructions` this will also be part of the "original" `Shipping Instructions` payload in the `requestedChanges` property. This property is **conditional** on the `shippingInstructionsStatus='PENDING UPDATE'`.

        In case no subscription (`Notification`) has been set up - it is possible to use this endPoint to poll on in order to detect if `shippingInstructionsStatus` and/or `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` has changed.

        A way for the consumer to Cancel an `Updated Shipping Instructions`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 5 - Cancel update to Shipping Instructions**.
        
        ## Precondition
        In order to cancel an `Updated Shipping Instructions`, the status of the `Updated Shipping Instructions` must be in in status `UPDATE RECEIVED`. The status of the `Shipping Instructions` can be either `RECEIVED` or `PENDING UPDATE`.

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received a cancellation from the consumer for an `Updated Shipping Instructions` that is in state `UPDATE RECEIVED`.
        
        The consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.
        
        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives a cancellation:
        1. The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        
           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid
        3. The `updatedShippingInstructionsStatus` is set to `UPDATE CANCELLED`.
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Shipping Instructions Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/shipping-instructions-notifications).

        A way for the consumer to Approve the `Draft Transport Document`. This endPoint corresponds with **UseCase 7 - Approve Draft Transport Document**.
        
        ## Precondition
        In order to approve a `Draft Transport Document`, the status of the `Transport Document` needs to be in status `DRAFT`

        ## Postcondition
        The provider has received an approval from the consumer for a `Transport Document` that is in state `DRAFT`.
        
        The consumer will receive a `200` (OK) if the payload schema-validates or a `400` (Bad Request) if it does not.
        
        ## Flow
        The following occurs when a provider receives an approval:
        1. The payload is schema-validated. In case the payload **is invalid** a `400` (Bad Request) is returned.
        
           **The process stops here!**
        2. The payload is schema-valid
        3. The `transportDocumentStatus` is set to `APPROVED`.
        4. All '_relevant_' subscribers will be notified via a [Transport Document Notification](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_EBL_NTF/3.0.0-Beta-1#/Notifications/transport-document-notifications).
        
        The provider wil now start asynchronous processing. Once processed, the new status of the `Transport Document` (`ISSUED`) will be communicated via a `Transport Document Notification`. In case the consumer does not subscribe to notifications it is necessary for the consumer to poll on the

            GET /v3/transport-documents/{transportDocumentReference}

        endPoint to check if the `transportDocumentStatus` in the `Transport Document` has changed.
