  title: DCSA OpenAPI specification for Arrival Notice
  description: |
    API specification issued by DCSA.org.

    For explanation of specific values or objects please refer to the [Information Model v2023.Q4](https://dcsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/DCSA-Information-Model-2023.Q4.pdf). This API specification does not define the allowable updates and their timing in accordance with the established business rules. Refer to the [DCSA Interface Standard for the Arrival Notice 1.0 Beta 1](http://...) to address this. **All use cases mentioned in this API specification refer to use cases defined in the AN IFS**.

    All other documents related to the Arrival Notice publication can be found [here](https://dcsa.org/standards/arrival-notice/)

    It is possible to use the AN API as a standalone API. In that case use one of the poll endPoints:

        GET /v1/arrival-notices/{transportDocumentReference}

    in order to poll information about `Arrival Notices`.

    ### Notifications
    It is possible to have notifications pushed to you whenever an Arrival Notice is ready. The format of the notification is defined by the [Arrival Notice Notification API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/dcsaorg/DCSA_AN_NTF/1.0.0-Beta-1). Signing up for notifications is defined outside the scope of this API specification.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to this API. Further details can be found [here](https://labs.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api/introduction)
