    API specification issued by DCSA.org.

    Operational Reefer Monitoring Notifications for [DCSA OpenAPI specification for Operational Reefer Monitoring](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/dcsaorg/DCSA_RMO/1.0.0-Beta-1) is a lightweight notification based on [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/). The `POST` endPoint of the consumer is called whenever a `Reefer` that is being subscribed to changes state or is updated.

    Subscribing to notification is done outside scope of this API.

    ### Stats API
    The Stats API offers crucial statistical information for both API providers and consumers to enhance their services and helps DCSA to understand and scale the ecosystem. We expect you to invoke the Stats API for every request made to the Operational Reefer Monitoring Notification API. Further details can be found [here](https://developer.dcsa.org/#/http/guides/api-guides/stats-api)

        `CloudEvent` specific properties for the `Notification`.
      properties:
        specversion:
          type: string
          description: |
            The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses. This enables the interpretation of the context. Compliant event producers MUST use a value of `1.0` when referring to this version of the specification.

            Currently, this attribute will only have the 'major' and 'minor' version numbers included in it. This allows for 'patch' changes to the specification to be made without changing this property's value in the serialization. Note: for 'release candidate' releases a suffix might be used for testing purposes.
          enum:
            - '1.0'
          example: '1.0'
        id:
          type: string
          maxLength: 100
          description: |
            Identifies the event. Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event. If a duplicate event is re-sent (e.g. due to a network error) it MAY have the same `id`. Consumers MAY assume that Events with identical `source` and `id` are duplicates.
          example: 3cecb101-7a1a-43a4-9d62-e88a131651e2
        source:
          type: string
          maxLength: 4096
          description: |
            Identifies the context in which an event happened. Often this will include information such as the type of the event source, the organization publishing the event or the process that produced the event. The exact syntax and semantics behind the data encoded in the URI is defined by the event producer.

            Producers MUST ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.

            An application MAY assign a unique `source` to each distinct producer, which makes it easy to produce unique IDs since no other producer will have the same source. The application MAY use UUIDs, URNs, DNS authorities or an application-specific scheme to create unique `source` identifiers.

            A source MAY include more than one producer. In that case the producers MUST collaborate to ensure that `source` + `id` is unique for each distinct event.
          example: 'https://member.com/'
        type:
          type: string
          description: |
            This attribute contains a value describing the type of event related to the originating occurrence. Often this attribute is used for routing, observability, policy enforcement, etc. The format of this is producer defined and might include information such as the version of the type - see [Versioning of CloudEvents in the Primer](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0.2/cloudevents/primer.md#versioning-of-cloudevents) for more information.
          enum:
            - org.dcsa.operational-reefer-notification.v1
          example: org.dcsa.operational-reefer-notification.v1
        time:
          type: string
          format: date-time
          description: |
            Timestamp of when the occurrence happened. If the time of the occurrence cannot be determined then this attribute MAY be set to some other time (such as the current time) by the CloudEvents producer, however all producers for the same `source` MUST be consistent in this respect. In other words, either they all use the actual time of the occurrence or they all use the same algorithm to determine the value used.
          example: '2018-04-05T17:31:00Z'
        datacontenttype:
          type: string
          description: |
            Content type of `data` value. This attribute enables `data` to carry any type of content, whereby format and encoding might differ from that of the chosen event format. For example, an event rendered using the [JSON envelope](formats/json-format.md#3-envelope) format might carry an XML payload in `data`, and the consumer is informed by this attribute being set to "application/xml". The rules for how `data` content is rendered for different `datacontenttype` values are defined in the event format specifications; for example, the JSON event format defines the relationship in [section 3.1](formats/json-format.md#31-handling-of-data).

            For some binary mode protocol bindings, this field is directly mapped to the respective protocol's content-type metadata property. Normative rules for the binary mode and the content-type metadata mapping can be found in the respective protocol.

            In some event formats the `datacontenttype` attribute MAY be omitted. For example, if a JSON format event has no `datacontenttype` attribute, then it is implied that the `data` is a JSON value conforming to the "application/json" media type. In other words: a JSON-format event with no `datacontenttype` is exactly equivalent to one with `datacontenttype="application/json"`.

            When translating an event message with no `datacontenttype` attribute to a different format or protocol binding, the target `datacontenttype` SHOULD be set explicitly to the implied `datacontenttype` of the source.

                                If a container does not comply with ISO 6346, it is suggested to follow [Recommendation #2: Containers with non-ISO identification](https://smdg.org/documents/smdg-recommendations) from SMDG.
